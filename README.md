# [Explainable Fact Checking through Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05369)
Code will be available soon

## Dataset
The dataset is available at: [Fool Me Twice](https://github.com/google-research/fool-me-twice)

### Question and Answer Generation
We adopt the approach to generate questions and answers from claims simultaneously. Specifically, we follow the instruction from [Nan et al.](https://github.com/amazon-research/fact-check-summarization) to fine-tune the BART-large model to generation question-answer pairs
